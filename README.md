Bliss Engine CMS
================

[Bliss Engine](http://www.blissengine.org/) is a brand new CMS!

Released under a [XXXXX license](http://www.blissengine.org/license), Bliss Engine can be used legally for any website.

## Documentation
Bliss Engine's documentation can (not really) be found at <http://www.blissengine.org/documentation>.

The `userguide` module included in all Kohana releases also allows you to view the documentation locally. Once the `userguide` module is enabled in the bootstrap, it is accessible from your site via `/index.php/guide` (or just `/guide` if you are rewriting your URLs).

## Reporting bugs
If you've stumbled upon a bug, you could report it. But there is no bug tracker yet. But this is what you'd be required to submit:

* Steps to reproduce
* Expected result
* Actual result
